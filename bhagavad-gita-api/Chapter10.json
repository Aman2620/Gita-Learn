While K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a was present on this earth, He displayed all six opulences. Therefore great sages like Par\u0101\u015bara Muni have all accepted K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Now K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is instructing Arjuna in more confidential knowledge of His opulences and His work. Previously, beginning with the Seventh Chapter, the Lord has already explained His different energies and how they are acting. Now in this chapter He explains His specific opulences to Arjuna. In the previous chapter He has clearly explained His different energies to establish devotion in firm conviction. Again in this chapter He tells Arjuna about His manifestations and various opulences."

Now buddhi-yoga is explained. Buddhi-yoga itself is action in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness; that is the highest intelligence. Buddhi means intelligence, and yoga means mystic activities or mystic elevation. When one tries to go back home, back to Godhead, and takes fully to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness in devotional service, his action is called buddhi-yoga. In other words, buddhi-yoga is the process by which one gets out of the entanglement of this material world. The ultimate goal of progress is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. People do not know this; therefore the association of devotees and a bona fide spiritual master are important. One should know that the goal is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and when the goal is assigned, then the path is slowly but progressively traversed, and the ultimate goal is achieved."

        "purport": "As it is stated in the previous chapter, the Supreme Personality of Godhead is covered by His yoga-m\u0101y\u0101. Only surrendered souls and devotees can see Him. Now Arjuna is convinced that his friend, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is the Supreme Godhead, but he wants to know the general process by which the all-pervading Lord can be understood by the common man. Common men, including the demons and atheists, cannot know K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, because He is guarded by His yoga-m\u0101y\u0101 energy. Again, these questions are asked by Arjuna for their benefit. The superior devotee is concerned not only for his own understanding but for the understanding of all mankind. So Arjuna, out of his mercy, because he is a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, a devotee, is opening for the common man the understanding of the all-pervasiveness of the Supreme Lord. He addresses K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a specifically as yogin because \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the master of the yoga-m\u0101y\u0101 energy, by which He is covered and uncovered to the common man. The common man who has no love for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a cannot always think of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a; therefore he has to think materially. Arjuna is considering the mode of thinking of the materialistic persons of this world. The words ke\u1e63u ke\u1e63u ca bh\u0101ve\u1e63u refer to material nature (the word bh\u0101va means \u201cphysical things\u201d). Because materialists cannot understand K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a spiritually, they are advised to concentrate the mind on physical things and try to see how K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is manifested by physical representations."
