The word \u201cMadhus\u016bdana\u201d is significant in this verse. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a killed the demon Madhu, and now Arjuna wanted K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to kill the demon of misunderstanding that had overtaken him in the discharge of his duty. No one knows where compassion should be applied. Compassion for the dress of a drowning man is senseless. A man fallen in the ocean of nescience cannot be saved simply by rescuing his outward dress \u2013 the gross material body. One who does not know this and laments for the outward dress is called a \u015b\u016bdra, or one who laments unnecessarily. Arjuna was a k\u1e63atriya, and this conduct was not expected from him. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, however, can dissipate the lamentation of the ignorant man, and for this purpose the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 was sung by Him. This chapter instructs us in self-realization by an analytical study of the material body and the spirit soul, as explained by the supreme authority, Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This realization is possible when one works without attachment to fruitive results and is situated in the fixed conception of the real self."

Therefore Arjuna had a blood relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.

Arjuna might argue that he would give up the battle on the grounds of his magnanimous attitude for the most respectable Bh\u012b\u1e63ma and his relatives, but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a considered that sort of magnanimity mere weakness of heart.

        "purport": "Arjuna did not know whether he should fight and risk unnecessary violence, although fighting is the duty of the k\u1e63atriyas, or whether he should refrain and live by begging. If he did not conquer the enemy, begging would be his only means of subsistence. Nor was there certainty of victory, because either side might emerge victorious. Even if victory awaited them (and their cause was justified), still, if the sons of Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra died in battle, it would be very difficult to live in their absence. Under the circumstances, that would be another kind of defeat for them. All these considerations by Arjuna definitely proved that not only was he a great devotee of the Lord but he was also highly enlightened and had complete control over his mind and senses. His desire to live by begging, although he was born in the royal household, is another sign of detachment. He was truly virtuous, as these qualities, combined with his faith in the words of instruction of \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (his spiritual master), indicate. It is concluded that Arjuna was quite fit for liberation. Unless the senses are controlled, there is no chance of elevation to the platform of knowledge, and without knowledge and devotion there is no chance of liberation. Arjuna was competent in all these attributes, over and above his enormous attributes in his material relationships."

In every step there is perplexity, and therefore it behooves one to approach a bona fide spiritual master who can give one proper guidance for executing the purpose of life. All Vedic literatures advise us to approach a bona fide spiritual master to get free from the perplexities of life, which happen without our desire. They are like a forest fire that somehow blazes without being set by anyone. Similarly, the world situation is such that perplexities of life automatically appear, without our wanting such confusion. No one wants fire, and yet it takes place, and we become perplexed. The Vedic wisdom therefore advises that in order to solve the perplexities of life and to understand the science of the solution, one must approach a spiritual master who is in the disciplic succession. A person with a bona fide spiritual master is supposed to know everything. One should not, therefore, remain in material perplexities but should approach a spiritual master. This is the purport of this verse."

Arjuna argued that religious principles should be given more importance than politics or sociology, but he did not know that knowledge of matter, soul and the Supreme is even more important than religious formularies. And because he was lacking in that knowledge, he should not have posed himself as a very learned man. As he did not happen to be a very learned man, he was consequently lamenting for something which was unworthy of lamentation. The body is born and is destined to be vanquished today or tomorrow; therefore the body is not as important as the soul. One who knows this is actually learned, and for him there is no cause for lamentation, regardless of the condition of the material body."

Similarly, in Arjuna\u2019s discharge of duties as a k\u1e63atriya, he is advised to persevere, even if it is difficult to fight with his family members or similarly beloved persons. Lord Caitanya took sanny\u0101sa at the age of twenty-four, and His dependents, young wife as well as old mother, had no one else to look after them. Yet for a higher cause He took sanny\u0101sa and was steady in the discharge of higher duties. That is the way of achieving liberation from material bondage."

There is no chance of maintaining it indefinitely. But the spirit soul is so minute that it cannot even be seen by an enemy, to say nothing of being killed. As mentioned in the previous verse, it is so small that no one can have any idea how to measure its dimension. So from both viewpoints there is no cause of lamentation, because the living entity as he is cannot be killed nor can the material body be saved for any length of time or permanently protected. The minute particle of the whole spirit acquires this material body according to his work, and therefore observance of religious principles should be utilized. In the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btras the living entity is qualified as light because he is part and parcel of the supreme light. As sunlight maintains the entire universe, so the light of the soul maintains this material body. As soon as the spirit soul is out of this material body, the body begins to decompose; therefore it is the spirit soul which maintains this body. The body itself is unimportant. Arjuna was advised to fight and not sacrifice the cause of religion for material, bodily considerations."

The Vedic injunction is m\u0101 hi\u1e41sy\u0101t sarv\u0101 bh\u016bt\u0101ni: never commit violence to anyone. Nor does understanding that the living entity is not killed encourage animal slaughter.

Arjuna, however, is being engaged in killing for the principle of religion, and not whimsically."

It takes its birth from the womb of the mother\u2019s body, remains for some time, grows, produces some effects, gradually dwindles, and at last vanishes into oblivion. The soul, however, does not go through such changes. The soul is not born, but, because he takes on a material body, the body takes its birth. The soul does not take birth there, and the soul does not die. Anything which has birth also has death. And because the soul has no birth, he therefore has no past, present or future. He is eternal, ever-existing and primeval \u2013 that is, there is no trace in history of his coming into being. Under the impression of the body, we seek the history of birth, etc., of the soul. The soul does not at any time become old, as the body does. The so-called old man, therefore, feels himself to be in the same spirit as in his childhood or youth. The changes of the body do not affect the soul. The soul does not deteriorate like a tree, nor anything material. The soul has no by-product either. The by-products of the body, namely children, are also different individual souls; and, owing to the body, they appear as children of a particular man. The body develops because of the soul\u2019s presence, but the soul has neither offshoots nor change. Therefore, the soul is free from the six changes of the body."

Similarly, violence also has its utility, and how to apply violence rests with the person in knowledge.

In Manu-sa\u1e41hit\u0101, the lawbook for mankind, it is supported that a murderer should be condemned to death so that in his next life he will not have to suffer for the great sin he has committed. Therefore, the king\u2019s punishment of hanging a murderer is actually beneficial. Similarly, when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a orders fighting, it must be concluded that violence is for supreme justice, and thus Arjuna should follow the instruction, knowing well that such violence, committed in the act of fighting for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is not violence at all because, at any rate, the man, or rather the soul, cannot be killed; so for the administration of justice, so-called violence is permitted. A surgical operation is not meant to kill the patient, but to cure him. Therefore the fighting to be executed by Arjuna at the instruction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is with full knowledge, so there is no possibility of sinful reaction."

We have to accept this truth, because there is no other source of understanding the existence of the soul, although it is a fact by perception. There are many things we have to accept solely on grounds of superior authority. No one can deny the existence of his father, based upon the authority of his mother. There is no source of understanding the identity of the father except by the authority of the mother. Similarly, there is no source of understanding the soul except by studying the Vedas. In other words, the soul is inconceivable by human experimental knowledge. The soul is consciousness and conscious \u2013 that also is the statement of the Vedas, and we have to accept that. Unlike the bodily changes, there is no change in the soul. As eternally unchangeable, the soul remains atomic in comparison to the infinite Supreme Soul. The Supreme Soul is infinite, and the atomic soul is infinitesimal. Therefore, the infinitesimal soul, being unchangeable, can never become equal to the infinite soul, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This concept is repeated in the Vedas in different ways just to confirm the stability of the conception of the soul. Repetition of something is necessary in order that we understand the matter thoroughly, without error."

Such philosophers maintain that life symptoms take place at a certain mature condition of material combination. The modern material scientist and materialist philosophers also think similarly. According to them, the body is a combination of physical elements, and at a certain stage the life symptoms develop by interaction of the physical and chemical elements. The science of anthropology is based on this philosophy. Currently, many pseudo religions \u2013 now becoming fashionable in America \u2013 are also adhering to this philosophy, as are the nihilistic nondevotional Buddhist sects."

Yet even if, for argument\u2019s sake, we accept this atheistic theory, there is still no cause for lamentation. Apart from the separate existence of the soul, the material elements remain unmanifested before creation. From this subtle state of nonmanifestation comes manifestation, just as from ether, air is generated; from air, fire is generated; from fire, water is generated; and from water, earth becomes manifested. From the earth, many varieties of manifestations take place. Take, for example, a big skyscraper manifested from the earth.

The law of conservation of energy remains, but in course of time things are manifested and unmanifested \u2013 that is the difference. Then what cause is there for lamentation either in the stage of manifestation or in unmanifestation? Somehow or other, even in the unmanifested stage, things are not lost. Both at the beginning and at the end, all elements remain unmanifested, and only in the middle are they manifested, and this does not make any real material difference."

In describing the immortal soul in various ways, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a establishes that the soul is immortal and the body is temporary. Therefore Arjuna as a k\u1e63atriya should not abandon his duty out of fear that his grandfather and teacher \u2013 Bh\u012b\u1e63ma and Dro\u1e47a \u2013 will die in the battle. On the authority of \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one has to believe that there is a soul different from the material body, not that there is no such thing as soul, or that living symptoms develop at a certain stage of material maturity resulting from the interaction of chemicals. Though the soul is immortal, violence is not encouraged, but at the time of war it is not discouraged when there is actual need for it. That need must be justified in terms of the sanction of the Lord, and not capriciously."
