The word \u201cMadhus\u016bdana\u201d is significant in this verse. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a killed the demon Madhu, and now Arjuna wanted K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a to kill the demon of misunderstanding that had overtaken him in the discharge of his duty. No one knows where compassion should be applied. Compassion for the dress of a drowning man is senseless. A man fallen in the ocean of nescience cannot be saved simply by rescuing his outward dress \u2013 the gross material body. One who does not know this and laments for the outward dress is called a \u015b\u016bdra, or one who laments unnecessarily. Arjuna was a k\u1e63atriya, and this conduct was not expected from him. Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, however, can dissipate the lamentation of the ignorant man, and for this purpose the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 was sung by Him. This chapter instructs us in self-realization by an analytical study of the material body and the spirit soul, as explained by the supreme authority, Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. This realization is possible when one works without attachment to fruitive results and is situated in the fixed conception of the real self."

Therefore Arjuna had a blood relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.

Therefore K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a said that such an attitude in Arjuna did not fit his personality. Arjuna might argue that he would give up the battle on the grounds of his magnanimous attitude for the most respectable Bh\u012b\u1e63ma and his relatives, but K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a considered that sort of magnanimity mere weakness of heart.

        "purport": "Arjuna did not know whether he should fight and risk unnecessary violence, although fighting is the duty of the k\u1e63atriyas, or whether he should refrain and live by begging. If he did not conquer the enemy, begging would be his only means of subsistence. Nor was there certainty of victory, because either side might emerge victorious. Even if victory awaited them (and their cause was justified), still, if the sons of Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra died in battle, it would be very difficult to live in their absence. Under the circumstances, that would be another kind of defeat for them. All these considerations by Arjuna definitely proved that not only was he a great devotee of the Lord but he was also highly enlightened and had complete control over his mind and senses. His desire to live by begging, although he was born in the royal household, is another sign of detachment. He was truly virtuous, as these qualities, combined with his faith in the words of instruction of \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (his spiritual master), indicate. It is concluded that Arjuna was quite fit for liberation. Unless the senses are controlled, there is no chance of elevation to the platform of knowledge, and without knowledge and devotion there is no chance of liberation. Arjuna was competent in all these attributes, over and above his enormous attributes in his material relationships."

In every step there is perplexity, and therefore it behooves one to approach a bona fide spiritual master who can give one proper guidance for executing the purpose of life. All Vedic literatures advise us to approach a bona fide spiritual master to get free from the perplexities of life, which happen without our desire. They are like a forest fire that somehow blazes without being set by anyone. Similarly, the world situation is such that perplexities of life automatically appear, without our wanting such confusion. No one wants fire, and yet it takes place, and we become perplexed. The Vedic wisdom therefore advises that in order to solve the perplexities of life and to understand the science of the solution, one must approach a spiritual master who is in the disciplic succession. A person with a bona fide spiritual master is supposed to know everything. One should not, therefore, remain in material perplexities but should approach a spiritual master. This is the purport of this verse."

Arjuna argued that religious principles should be given more importance than politics or sociology, but he did not know that knowledge of matter, soul and the Supreme is even more important than religious formularies. And because he was lacking in that knowledge, he should not have posed himself as a very learned man. As he did not happen to be a very learned man, he was consequently lamenting for something which was unworthy of lamentation. The body is born and is destined to be vanquished today or tomorrow; therefore the body is not as important as the soul. One who knows this is actually learned, and for him there is no cause for lamentation, regardless of the condition of the material body."

Similarly, in Arjuna\u2019s discharge of duties as a k\u1e63atriya, he is advised to persevere, even if it is difficult to fight with his family members or similarly beloved persons. Lord Caitanya took sanny\u0101sa at the age of twenty-four, and His dependents, young wife as well as old mother, had no one else to look after them. Yet for a higher cause He took sanny\u0101sa and was steady in the discharge of higher duties. That is the way of achieving liberation from material bondage."

There is no chance of maintaining it indefinitely. But the spirit soul is so minute that it cannot even be seen by an enemy, to say nothing of being killed. As mentioned in the previous verse, it is so small that no one can have any idea how to measure its dimension. So from both viewpoints there is no cause of lamentation, because the living entity as he is cannot be killed nor can the material body be saved for any length of time or permanently protected. The minute particle of the whole spirit acquires this material body according to his work, and therefore observance of religious principles should be utilized. In the Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btras the living entity is qualified as light because he is part and parcel of the supreme light. As sunlight maintains the entire universe, so the light of the soul maintains this material body. As soon as the spirit soul is out of this material body, the body begins to decompose; therefore it is the spirit soul which maintains this body. The body itself is unimportant. Arjuna was advised to fight and not sacrifice the cause of religion for material, bodily considerations."

The Vedic injunction is m\u0101 hi\u1e41sy\u0101t sarv\u0101 bh\u016bt\u0101ni: never commit violence to anyone. Nor does understanding that the living entity is not killed encourage animal slaughter.

It takes its birth from the womb of the mother\u2019s body, remains for some time, grows, produces some effects, gradually dwindles, and at last vanishes into oblivion. The soul, however, does not go through such changes. The soul is not born, but, because he takes on a material body, the body takes its birth. The soul does not take birth there, and the soul does not die. Anything which has birth also has death. And because the soul has no birth, he therefore has no past, present or future. He is eternal, ever-existing and primeval \u2013 that is, there is no trace in history of his coming into being. Under the impression of the body, we seek the history of birth, etc., of the soul. The soul does not at any time become old, as the body does. The so-called old man, therefore, feels himself to be in the same spirit as in his childhood or youth. The changes of the body do not affect the soul. The soul does not deteriorate like a tree, nor anything material. The soul has no by-product either. The by-products of the body, namely children, are also different individual souls; and, owing to the body, they appear as children of a particular man. The body develops because of the soul\u2019s presence, but the soul has neither offshoots nor change. Therefore, the soul is free from the six changes of the body."

Similarly, violence also has its utility, and how to apply violence rests with the person in knowledge.

In Manu-sa\u1e41hit\u0101, the lawbook for mankind, it is supported that a murderer should be condemned to death so that in his next life he will not have to suffer for the great sin he has committed. Therefore, the king\u2019s punishment of hanging a murderer is actually beneficial. Similarly, when K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a orders fighting, it must be concluded that violence is for supreme justice, and thus Arjuna should follow the instruction, knowing well that such violence, committed in the act of fighting for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, is not violence at all because, at any rate, the man, or rather the soul, cannot be killed; so for the administration of justice, so-called violence is permitted. A surgical operation is not meant to kill the patient, but to cure him. Therefore the fighting to be executed by Arjuna at the instruction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is with full knowledge, so there is no possibility of sinful reaction."

We have to accept this truth, because there is no other source of understanding the existence of the soul, although it is a fact by perception. There are many things we have to accept solely on grounds of superior authority. No one can deny the existence of his father, based upon the authority of his mother. There is no source of understanding the identity of the father except by the authority of the mother. Similarly, there is no source of understanding the soul except by studying the Vedas. In other words, the soul is inconceivable by human experimental knowledge. The soul is consciousness and conscious \u2013 that also is the statement of the Vedas, and we have to accept that. Unlike the bodily changes, there is no change in the soul. As eternally unchangeable, the soul remains atomic in comparison to the infinite Supreme Soul. The Supreme Soul is infinite, and the atomic soul is infinitesimal. Therefore, the infinitesimal soul, being unchangeable, can never become equal to the infinite soul, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This concept is repeated in the Vedas in different ways just to confirm the stability of the conception of the soul. Repetition of something is necessary in order that we understand the matter thoroughly, without error."

Such philosophers maintain that life symptoms take place at a certain mature condition of material combination. The modern material scientist and materialist philosophers also think similarly. According to them, the body is a combination of physical elements, and at a certain stage the life symptoms develop by interaction of the physical and chemical elements. The science of anthropology is based on this philosophy. Currently, many pseudo religions \u2013 now becoming fashionable in America \u2013 are also adhering to this philosophy, as are the nihilistic nondevotional Buddhist sects."

Yet even if, for argument\u2019s sake, we accept this atheistic theory, there is still no cause for lamentation. Apart from the separate existence of the soul, the material elements remain unmanifested before creation. From this subtle state of nonmanifestation comes manifestation, just as from ether, air is generated; from air, fire is generated; from fire, water is generated; and from water, earth becomes manifested. From the earth, many varieties of manifestations take place. Take, for example, a big skyscraper manifested from the earth.

The law of conservation of energy remains, but in course of time things are manifested and unmanifested \u2013 that is the difference. Then what cause is there for lamentation either in the stage of manifestation or in unmanifestation? Somehow or other, even in the unmanifested stage, things are not lost. Both at the beginning and at the end, all elements remain unmanifested, and only in the middle are they manifested, and this does not make any real material difference."

        "purport": "According to the Nirukti, or the Vedic dictionary, sa\u1e45khy\u0101 means that which describes things in detail, and s\u0101\u1e45khya refers to that philosophy which describes the real nature of the soul. And yoga involves controlling the senses. Arjuna\u2019s proposal not to fight was based on sense gratification. Forgetting his prime duty, he wanted to cease fighting, because he thought that by not killing his relatives and kinsmen he would be happier than by enjoying the kingdom after conquering his cousins and brothers, the sons of Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra. In both ways, the basic principles were for sense gratification. Happiness derived from conquering them and happiness derived by seeing kinsmen alive are both on the basis of personal sense gratification, even at a sacrifice of wisdom and duty. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, therefore, wanted to explain to Arjuna that by killing the body of his grandfather he would not be killing the soul proper, and He explained that all individual persons, including the Lord Himself, are eternal individuals; they were individuals in the past, they are individuals in the present, and they will continue to remain individuals in the future, because all of us are individual souls eternally. We simply change our bodily dress in different manners, but actually we keep our individuality even after liberation from the bondage of material dress. An analytical study of the soul and the body has been very graphically explained by Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. And this descriptive knowledge of the soul and the body from different angles of vision has been described here as S\u0101\u1e45khya, in terms of the Nirukti dictionary. This S\u0101\u1e45khya has nothing to do with the S\u0101\u1e45khya philosophy of the atheist Kapila. Long before the imposter Kapila\u2019s S\u0101\u1e45khya, the S\u0101\u1e45khya philosophy was expounded in the \u015ar\u012bmad-Bh\u0101gavatam by the true Lord Kapila, the incarnation of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who explained it to His mother, Devah\u016bti. It is clearly explained by Him that the puru\u1e63a, or the Supreme Lord, is active and that He creates by looking over the prak\u1e5bti. This is accepted in the Vedas and in the G\u012bt\u0101. The description in the Vedas indicates that the Lord glanced over the prak\u1e5bti, or nature, and impregnated it with atomic individual souls. All these individuals are working in the material world for sense gratification, and under the spell of material energy they are thinking of being enjoyers. This mentality is dragged to the last point of liberation when the living entity wants to become one with the Lord. This is the last snare of m\u0101y\u0101, or sense gratificatory illusion, and it is only after many, many births of such sense gratificatory activities that a great soul surrenders unto V\u0101sudeva, Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, thereby fulfilling the search after the ultimate truth."

The relationship of the living entities with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is also mentioned in the Fifteenth Chapter of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 (15.7).

Only misers desire to enjoy the fruit of their own work just to be further entangled in material bondage. Except for work in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, all activities are abominable because they continually bind the worker to the cycle of birth and death. One should therefore never desire to be the cause of work. Everything should be done in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, for the satisfaction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.

Like misers, unfortunate persons do not employ their human energy in the service of the Lord."

Consequently, it is rightly said herein that one has to give up all kinds of sense desire manufactured by mental concoction. Artificially, such sense desires cannot be stopped. But if one is engaged in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, then, automatically, sense desires subside without extraneous efforts. Therefore, one has to engage himself in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness without hesitation, for this devotional service will instantly help one onto the platform of transcendental consciousness. The highly developed soul always remains satisfied in himself by realizing himself as the eternal servitor of the Supreme Lord. Such a transcendentally situated person has no sense desires resulting from petty materialism; rather, he remains always happy in his natural position of eternally serving the Supreme Lord."

It is said that every muni has a different angle of vision, and unless a muni differs from other munis, he cannot be called a muni in the strict sense of the term. N\u0101s\u0101v \u1e5b\u1e63ir yasya mata\u1e41 na bhinnam (Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, Vana-parva 313.117). But a sthita-dh\u012br muni, as mentioned herein by the Lord, is different from an ordinary muni. The sthita-dh\u012br muni is always in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, for he has exhausted all his business of creative speculation. He is called pra\u015b\u0101nta-ni\u1e25\u015be\u1e63a-mano-rath\u0101ntara (Stotra-ratna 43), or one who has surpassed the stage of mental speculations and has come to the conclusion that Lord \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, or V\u0101sudeva, is everything (v\u0101sudeva\u1e25 sarvam iti sa mah\u0101tm\u0101 su-durlabha\u1e25). He is called a muni fixed in mind. Such a fully K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person is not at all disturbed by the onslaughts of the threefold miseries, for he accepts all miseries as the mercy of the Lord, thinking himself only worthy of more trouble due to his past misdeeds; and he sees that his miseries, by the grace of the Lord, are minimized to the lowest. Similarly, when he is happy he gives credit to the Lord, thinking himself unworthy of the happiness; he realizes that it is due only to the Lord\u2019s grace that he is in such a comfortable condition and able to render better service to the Lord. And, for the service of the Lord, he is always daring and active and is not influenced by attachment or aversion. Attachment means accepting things for one\u2019s own sense gratification, and detachment is the absence of such sensual attachment. But one fixed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness has neither attachment nor detachment because his life is dedicated in the service of the Lord. Consequently he is not at all angry even when his attempts are unsuccessful. Success or no success, a K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious person is always steady in his determination."

Most people, however, are servants of the senses and are thus directed by the dictation of the senses. That is the answer to the question as to how the yog\u012b is situated. The senses are compared to venomous serpents. They want to act very loosely and without restriction. The yog\u012b, or the devotee, must be very strong to control the serpents \u2013 like a snake charmer. He never allows them to act independently. There are many injunctions in the revealed scriptures; some of them are do-not\u2019s, and some of them are do\u2019s. Unless one is able to follow the do\u2019s and the do-not\u2019s, restricting oneself from sense enjoyment, it is not possible to be firmly fixed in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. The best example, set herein, is the tortoise. The tortoise can at any moment wind up its senses and exhibit them again at any time for particular purposes. Similarly, the senses of the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious persons are used only for some particular purpose in the service of the Lord and are withdrawn otherwise. Arjuna is being taught here to use his senses for the service of the Lord, instead of for his own satisfaction. Keeping the senses always in the service of the Lord is the example set by the analogy of the tortoise, who keeps the senses within."

Even Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra, a great sage and perfect yog\u012b, was misled by Menak\u0101 into sex enjoyment, although the yog\u012b was endeavoring for sense control with severe types of penance and yoga practice. And, of course, there are so many similar instances in the history of the world. Therefore, it is very difficult to control the mind and senses without being fully K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious. Without engaging the mind in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, one cannot cease such material engagements. A practical example is given by \u015ar\u012b Y\u0101mun\u0101c\u0101rya, a great saint and devotee, who says:"

The senses require real engagements, and if they are not engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, they will certainly seek engagement in the service of materialism. In the material world everyone, including Lord \u015aiva and Lord Brahm\u0101 \u2013 to say nothing of other demigods in the heavenly planets \u2013 is subjected to the influence of sense objects, and the only method to get out of this puzzle of material existence is to become K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious. Lord \u015aiva was deep in meditation, but when P\u0101rvat\u012b agitated him for sense pleasure, he agreed to the proposal, and as a result K\u0101rtikeya was born. When Harid\u0101sa \u1e6ch\u0101kura was a young devotee of the Lord, he was similarly allured by the incarnation of M\u0101y\u0101-dev\u012b, but Harid\u0101sa easily passed the test because of his unalloyed devotion to Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. As illustrated in the above-mentioned verse of \u015ar\u012b Y\u0101mun\u0101c\u0101rya, a sincere devotee of the Lord shuns all material sense enjoyment due to his higher taste for spiritual enjoyment in the association of the Lord. That is the secret of success. One who is not, therefore, in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, however powerful he may be in controlling the senses by artificial repression, is sure ultimately to fail, for the slightest thought of sense pleasure will agitate him to gratify his desires."

So it is confirmed in the Fifth Chapter (5.29) that when one understands that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the only enjoyer of all the good results of sacrifice and penance, that He is the proprietor of all universal manifestations, and that He is the real friend of all living entities, then only can one have real peace. Therefore, if one is not in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness, there cannot be a final goal for the mind. Disturbance is due to want of an ultimate goal, and when one is certain that K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the enjoyer, proprietor and friend of everyone and everything, then one can, with a steady mind, bring about peace. Therefore, one who is engaged without a relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is certainly always in distress and is without peace, however much he may make a show of peace and spiritual advancement in life. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is a self-manifested peaceful condition which can be achieved only in relationship with K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a."

The fruitive workers, the salvationists, and also the yog\u012bs who are after mystic powers are all unhappy because of unfulfilled desires. But the person in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is happy in the service of the Lord, and he has no desires to be fulfilled. In fact, he does not even desire liberation from the so-called material bondage. The devotees of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a have no material desires, and therefore they are in perfect peace."

To understand one\u2019s actual position as the eternal servitor of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, without falsely claiming this material body to be oneself and without falsely claiming proprietorship over anything in the world, is the perfect stage of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness.

Arjuna did not want to fight for his own sense satisfaction, but when he became fully K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious he fought because K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a wanted him to fight. For himself there was no desire to fight, but for K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a the same Arjuna fought to his best ability. Real desirelessness is desire for the satisfaction of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, not an artificial attempt to abolish desires. The living entity cannot be desireless or senseless, but he does have to change the quality of the desires. A materially desireless person certainly knows that everything belongs to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a (\u012b\u015b\u0101v\u0101syam ida\u1e41 sarvam), and therefore he does not falsely claim proprietorship over anything. This transcendental knowledge is based on self-realization \u2013 namely, knowing perfectly well that every living entity is an eternal part and parcel of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a in spiritual identity, and that the eternal position of the living entity is therefore never on the level of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a or greater than Him. This understanding of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness is the basic principle of real peace."

        "purport": "One can attain K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness or divine life at once, within a second \u2013 or one may not attain such a state of life even after millions of births. It is only a matter of understanding and accepting the fact. Kha\u1e6dv\u0101\u1e45ga Mah\u0101r\u0101ja attained this state of life just a few minutes before his death, by surrendering unto K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. Nirv\u0101\u1e47a means ending the process of materialistic life. According to Buddhist philosophy, there is only void after the completion of this material life, but Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 teaches differently. Actual life begins after the completion of this material life. For the gross materialist it is sufficient to know that one has to end this materialistic way of life, but for persons who are spiritually advanced, there is another life after this materialistic life. Before ending this life, if one fortunately becomes K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a conscious, he at once attains the stage of brahma-nirv\u0101\u1e47a. There is no difference between the kingdom of God and the devotional service of the Lord. Since both of them are on the absolute plane, to be engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord is to have attained the spiritual kingdom. In the material world there are activities of sense gratification, whereas in the spiritual world there are activities of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness. Attainment of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness even during this life is immediate attainment of Brahman, and one who is situated in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness has certainly already entered into the kingdom of God."
